# Amca

AMCA is a lightweight automated tool that silently downloads and executes EXE files from a central NAS or file share, designed primarily for environments with many computers such as factories but also usable by individual users. 
It requires .NET 9+, allows you to configure the executable paths directly in the source code or via a simple configuration file, and supports optional checksum verification for integrity. 
The program downloads the target files, runs them with predefined silent arguments, and logs the results, making it useful for IT teams that need to deploy or update software across multiple machines with minimal user interaction.
